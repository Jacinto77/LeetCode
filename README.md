LeetCode solutions

My solutions to Leetcode problems while practicing for coding assessments and interviews. 

If you have not solved the leetcode problems that are completed and stored in this repo, 
please do yourself a favor and give them a try before spoiling the solution for yourself. 

The code in this repo is a combination of my own attempts (both passing and failing), along 
with code from Neetcode.io (or other sources) for when I could not for the life of me figure 
it out. 

The purpose of this repo is to have a history of my submissions and thought process when 
completing these coding challenges, so that I may look back in wonder at my own silliness. 

I spend about 3 hours maximum on a problem before researching the solution, if I haven't 
figured it out first. When I am able to solve the problem myself, I will still look into more 
optimized solutions or different coding patterns that solve the problem for my own learning 
and growth as a programmer and computer scientist. 

A textfile accompanies many of the python files in their own folders organized by problem 
number, which consists of notes, comments, non-working solutions, etc.
